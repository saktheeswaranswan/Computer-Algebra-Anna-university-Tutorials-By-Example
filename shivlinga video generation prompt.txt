Design an 8K hyper-realistic 3D render of a Lord Shiva lingam crafted from smooth, polished white marble, exuding a serene, divine aura. The lingam is set on an intricately carved stone pedestal with traditional motifs, emphasizing ancient Indian artistry. A cobra with striking red eyes coils elegantly around the lingam, each scale meticulously textured to catch the light, giving a sense of motion and protectiveness. The marble should have a subtle, natural translucency, with soft, diffused lighting bringing out its smooth texture and fine details. Surround the lingam with offerings such as delicate flower petals, leaves, and small oil lamps that cast a gentle, warm glow. Envelop the scene in a light, mystical fog, with divine rays filtering down to highlight the lingam and cobra, giving a sacred and aesthetic feel. The background remains dark and minimalist to focus on the marble lingam and cobra, with realistic shadowing and depth.
